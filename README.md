# Gentle Engineering Notes

Long-form engineering notes on modern iOS: Swift, SwiftUI, concurrency, testing, and architecture.

This repository serves as a living notebook of practical engineering patterns, test strategies, architectural decisions, and applied techniques drawn from real-world iOS development.

The goal is not to be exhaustive, but to be **clear, durable, and production-oriented**.

## 📚 Articles

### Testing & Quality
- **[Resilience Testing for iOS UI](./resilience-ios-ui-testing.md)**  
  Designing UI test harnesses that validate failure recovery, system robustness, and edge-case behavior in modern iOS apps.

_(More articles will be added as systems, tools, and architectural topics mature.)_

---

## 🎯 Focus Areas

- Swift & Swift Concurrency
- SwiftUI Architecture & State Management
- Unit, Integration, and UI Testing
- Resilience, Reliability, and Failure Recovery
- Applied Patterns for Production iOS Systems

## 🧭 How to Use These Notes

These articles are written to be:
- Read independently
- Referenced during system design
- Linked from project READMEs
- Used as discussion artifacts during interviews and technical reviews

Each article favors clarity, trade-offs, and real constraints over theoretical completeness.
