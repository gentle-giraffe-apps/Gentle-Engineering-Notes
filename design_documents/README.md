# Design Documents

High-level engineering design papers for future or existing components in the Gentle Giraffe ecosystem.

These documents focus on **system-level architecture**, describing:

- Core goals and requirements  
- Tradeoffs and constraints  
- Module & API boundaries  
- Concurrency and state-management strategies  
- Testing and mocking approaches  
- Extensibility and long-term maintainability  

Unlike the `best_practices` or `guides` folders, these are **not tutorials** and **not general advice**.  
They are forward-looking technical designs intended to serve as a foundation for production-quality frameworks and reusable components.

## Purpose

This directory establishes a clear, professional space for:

- Architectural explorations  
- Proposed designs for future Swift packages  
- component-level engineering strategy  
- Technical deep dives and system diagrams  
- Documents you might share with a team or hiring panel to showcase engineering skill

These design documents help communicate senior/staff-level thinking and provide a durable reference for large or complex projects within the Gentle Giraffe ecosystem.
