Senior iOS Job Search — Process Map (Anonymized & Approximate)

The job seeking process consists of a series of sequential phases. Below is a structural breakdown of the modern senior-level iOS hiring funnel as observed across multiple processes.

------------------------------------------------------------
I. Discovery & Application Phase
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Finding open positions.
- Tools used: 
a. LinkedIn - using the "Jobs where you’re more likely to hear back" section.
a.1. Always make sure that I'm applying to a real company and not a staffing agency or consultancy.
a.2. I seldom use the "Easy Apply" button, as that's a black hole, unless it's a highly desirable position and then I'll mark it as a top choice.
a.3. I make sure I match 95% of the required items. If not, I fear the ATS system will filter me out.
a.4. I scan for no-gos... i.e. "React Native, Kotlin Multiplatform, or Flutter/Dart, Core Data, or Swift Data".
a.4.i. Depending on the context, I may skip applying.
a.5. I target "Senior" and below. "Staff" positions in general weren't working for me. There seems to be role inflation happening across the board now.
a.6. Local hybrid or full time roles have higher response rates than remote, but I have gotten responses from remote positions, especially lower paid ones, despite the 200+ candidates application counts, with 40 per day.
b. Jobright.ai - posts new openings that are usually buried or harder to find in LinkedIn. I cross-reference with LinkedIn and can see the number of applicants.
c. Indeed - I used this a couple months ago, but seems like it's dried up.

2. Applying for those positions.
a. I fill out the app.
b. For the website field, I put my github account.
c. I don't customize my resume per position since they would detect differences by looking at LinkedIn.
d. I haven't been sending cover letters, but it might be something I consider.
e. It feels like they are either interested or not.

------------------------------------------------------------
II. Initial Response & Early Filtering
------------------------------------------------------------

3. Engaging after a response
- My response rate for applications is: 3 in 10 gets an eventual rejection. 1 in 10 gets a recruiter or automated advancement response. 6 in 10 are silent, and I never hear anything.

3.a. With a recruiter in a brief 30 min meeting.
- I try to respond with a times same or next day. About half of recruiters have a convenient calendar where I can pick a half hour slot. If not I have to propose a series of times
and dates.

b. I get through about 7 out of 10 of these. 
- Reasons for non-advancement can be the recruiter is overwhelmed and doesn't respond, the position closes, etc. Or there's a role clarification, or higher expectations than conveyed on the job description.

3.b. With an automated testing service, and scheduling a 1 or 2 hour automated exam.
- Automated testing services, include: codesignal and hackerrank
- I've been through two codesignal rounds in swift. They take about 2 to 3 hours and can be challenging the first time.
- I turned down a hackerank one, due to exhaustion over the weekend.

3.c. With an automated GitHub project evaluation.
- I've done one automated github evaluation. A github is repo is sent, you are asked to submit a PR against the repo after 3 hours. You are asked to agree not to use outside help or AI.
  - The project was ambitious for someone rusty in SwiftUI. It included SwiftUI gotchas and the ability to unit test combine code with promises as just some of aspects needed to complete.
  - Without the ability to use outside help or AI, it's a matter of whether you know the material or not, rather than ability to research and complete a task like a normal dev.

3.d. With a multiple choice skills assessment from a standards organization
- This was actually for a SDET position, and tested Swift and legacy UIKit and AVFoundation knowledge.
- The test had spelling and grammatical errors in it, and tested edge cases like variables being captured and modified within a closure for example.
- It was heavy on practical Apple knowledge and light on architecture, reasoning, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------
III. Early Evaluation Rounds (Human & Automated)
------------------------------------------------------------

4. Engaging in the next step.
4.a. A non-technical hiring manager interview.
4.b. A technical interview with an internal developer.
4.c. An automated technical assessment with CodeSignal.
4.d. An automated technical assessment with Byteboard.
4.e. An automated technical assessment with an external vendor with a real human interview via Karat.
4.f. A semi-technical prototyping round with a product manager.

------------------------------------------------------------
IV. Multi-Round Technical & Behavioral Assessment
------------------------------------------------------------

5. Engaging in a multi-round technical and behavioral assessment.
5.a. A team and collaborative interview with Product Manager.
5.b. A one-on-one live coding interview with an iOS expert (UIKit, SwiftUI).
5.c. A one-on-one technical conceptual interview covering iOS, Swift, SwiftUI, concurrency (new and legacy), architecture, and best practices.
5.d. A paired coding exercise fixing issues on a complex codebase.
5.e. An interview with the engineering manager.
5.f. An interview around networking and model decoding.
5.g. A system design interview centered on client concerns.
5.h. A multi-panel interview with 5 staff-level engineers and an architect, along with a LeetCode-style question at the end.
5.i. A one-on-one live coding interview with an expert staff-level platform member (staff-shaped coding exercise, e.g., task coalescing, caching, concurrency edge cases).
5.j. A one-on-one live coding interview fixing advanced combine unit tests on a challenging codebase.

------------------------------------------------------------
V. Alignment & Executive Review
------------------------------------------------------------

6. Engaging in alignment interviews following multi-round interviews.
6.a. An interview with the Chief Financial Officer.
6.b. An interview with VP of Product.
6.c. A behavioral and process interview with future boss and another engineering manager.
